# DeadCellsClone

A work-in-progress side-scrolling roguelike inspired by *Dead Cells*, developed using C, C++, and Make/CMake build systems.

## 🚀 Features

* **Roguelike Mechanics:** Procedurally generated levels, permadeath, and fast-paced gameplay.
* **Procedural Level Generation:** Levels are generated algorithmically to ensure varied gameplay each run.
* **Combat System:** Inspired by the fluid combat of *Dead Cells*, including basic melee and ranged mechanics.
* **Modular Codebase:** Written with modular design principles in mind, enabling easier maintenance and future expansion.
* **Cross-Platform Build Support:** Compiles using standard C++ compilers and supports both Makefile and CMake-based build systems.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure the following tools are installed:

* A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
* CMake (optional but recommended)
* GNU Make (if using Makefile)
* Git

### Build Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Punity122333/DeadCellsClone.git
cd DeadCellsClone
```

To build the project:

#### Using Makefile

```bash
make
```

#### Using CMake

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running the Game

Once successfully built, run the executable:

```bash
./SideScroller
```

## 🤔 Motivation

This project was created out of a passion for *Dead Cells* and game development. It serves both as a learning experience and a portfolio piece, exploring gameplay mechanics, procedural generation, and engine structure from the ground up.

## 🐛 Known Issues

* Occasional crashes or instability
* Some systems are incomplete or in prototype phase
* Code may not follow strict conventions in all areas (refactoring in progress)
